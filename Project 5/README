The file input_5.txt will contain the following inputs:
Line 1: An elementary function f(x) of the variable x, in the form of a string that can be converted to a
SymPy expression. This function will have a simple, elementary antiderivative.
Line 2: The domain of f(x) in the form of interval of the form [a;b], where a and b are floating point
numbers.
Line 3: An error tolerance epsilon, in the form of a positive floating point number.

The program does the following:
(1) Read the entries from the file input_5.txt and, where necessary, convert them to the correct data
types.
(2) Compute the definite integral of f(x) by using the SymPy function integrate to find an antiderivative 
of f and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus.
(3) Find the smallest number of subintervals M needed to guaranteed the definite integral of f(x) is 
approximated to within an error tolerance of e using trapezoid rule and the smallest number of subintervals 
N needed to guaranteed it within e using Simpsonâ€™s rule, based on the error bounds discussed in class.
(4) Compute the approximations given by the two rules for every integer from 1 to max{M;N} and the
associated uniform errors.
