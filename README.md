# MAT-364

Welcome to the repository for my Python projects developed as part of the MAT-364 Numerical Analysis class. In this course, I explored various numerical techniques and algorithms to solve mathematical problems, and implemented them using Python programming language. Below are brief descriptions of the projects included in this repository:
## 1. **Approximating Elementary Functions**
Learn to plot elementary functions, compute Taylor polynomials, and use Taylor polynomials to approximate elementary functions within given error bounds.
## 2. **Chopping versus rounding**
Quantify the errors that arise from summing finite series in various orders when using chopping and rounding.
## 3. **Root Finding Algorithms**
Implement root-finding algorithms (Bisection, Newton's, and Secant methods) to find roots of nonlinear equations. Each algorithm is thoroughly explained and demonstrated.
## 4. **Interpolation**
Numerically compute interpolating polynomials and find Chebyshev nodes. Compare the error in near-minimax polynomials with that of Taylor polynomials of the same degree and interpolating polynomials constructed using equally spaced interpolation points.
## 5. **Numerical Integration**
Numerically approximate integrals using the Trapezoid rule and Simpsonâ€™s rule. Determine the smallest number of subintervals needed to approximate an integral to within a given error bound using each.
